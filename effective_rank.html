        <h1>Measuring What Neural Networks Really Learn</h1>
        <p style="font-style: italic; color: #96a4ae;">Research paper: Estimating the Effective Rank of Vision Transformers via Low-Rank Factorization</p>

        <h2>The Paradox of Over-Parameterization</h2>
        <p>
            Modern neural networks are vastly over-parameterized. A Vision Transformer might have millions of parameters, yet it somehow learns useful representations without collapsing into memorization. This raises a fundamental question: <strong>how many dimensions does a neural network actually use?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            The answer lies hidden in the geometry of learned representations. While a network may have millions of parameters on paper, its learned representations often live in a much lower-dimensional subspace. Understanding this intrinsic dimensionality is crucial for compression, interpretability, and theoretical understanding of deep learning.
        </p>

        <h2>A New Framework: Geometric Distillation</h2>
        <p>
            In my recent paper, I introduce a framework for systematically estimating this intrinsic dimensionality through what I call <em>geometric distillation</em>. The approach is elegant in its simplicity:
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>The Method:</strong>
            <ol style="margin: 8px 0; padding-left: 20px;">
                <li>Train a full-rank "teacher" network to convergence</li>
                <li>Factorize its weight matrices at multiple ranks (r = 1, 2, 4, 8, ...)</li>
                <li>Train each low-rank "student" via knowledge distillation</li>
                <li>Measure performance as a function of rank</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <p>
            The key insight is treating learned representations as projections onto a low-rank subspace. By systematically varying the rank and measuring how well students can reconstruct the teacher's behavior, we can map out the model's intrinsic geometry.
        </p>

        <h2>Effective Rank as a Region</h2>
        <p>
            Traditional approaches try to pin down a single number for "effective rank." But this is the wrong question. A model's intrinsic dimensionality isn't a point—it's a <strong>region</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I define the effective rank as the smallest contiguous set of ranks where the student achieves 85-95% of the teacher's accuracy. This region captures the transition from under-capacity to sufficient representation. To stabilize these estimates, I fit the accuracy curve with a monotone PCHIP interpolant and identify where it crosses the normalized threshold.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also introduce the concept of an <strong>effective knee</strong>: the rank that maximizes perpendicular distance between the smoothed accuracy curve and its endpoint secant. This provides an intrinsic indicator of where marginal gains concentrate—the "sweet spot" of compression.
        </p>

        <h2>Results: 11× Compression with Minimal Loss</h2>
        <p>
            On Vision Transformers, the method achieves remarkable results. Through systematic low-rank factorization and distillation, I compressed models by <strong>11× in parameters while retaining 94.7% of the teacher's accuracy</strong>. The effective rank regions revealed that these massive models truly operate in surprisingly low-dimensional spaces.
        </p>

        <p>
            More importantly, the framework is <em>automated and algorithmic</em>. Unlike previous methods that require manual inspection or heuristics, this approach provides a systematic way to measure intrinsic dimensionality across different architectures, datasets, and training regimes.
        </p>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding the intrinsic dimensionality of neural networks has implications far beyond compression. It touches on fundamental questions:
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.7;">
            <li><strong>Generalization:</strong> Why do over-parameterized networks generalize? Perhaps because they converge to low-rank solutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Transfer Learning:</strong> What structure is truly shared across tasks? The low-rank subspace may be where transfer happens.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretability:</strong> By identifying the dimensions that matter, we can focus our interpretability efforts where they count.</li>
            <li><strong>Theory:</strong> A rigorous framework for measuring effective capacity bridges the gap between empirical practice and theoretical understanding.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>
            This work is a step toward understanding the true complexity of what neural networks learn. By treating rank as a measurable property rather than a static hyperparameter, we open new directions for exploring how dimensionality relates to architecture, data, and learning dynamics.
        </p>

        <p>
            The framework is general enough to apply to any architecture and any task. My hope is that it provides a foundation for future work on the geometry of learned representations and the nature of compression in deep learning.
