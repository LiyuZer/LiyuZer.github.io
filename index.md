# Hello Fellow Homo sapiens!

My name is **Liyu Zerihun**, and I am an undergrad at **UCLA**, currently studying **Computer Science**.  

I am quite passionate about **machine learning** and **algorithms** and am currently working on these projects:

- **[Automa]** - A graph programming language focused on computation and transitions, enabling dynamic graph creation and advanced algorithm representation.
- **[Rituals]** - A lifestyle optimization app. You can check out our website [here](#).

- [Machine Learning Library](https://github.com/LiyuZer/NBL-ML-Library-)  
- [EcoEats](https://github.com/LiyuZer/EcoEats)  
- [Iris](https://github.com/stephanienguyen2020/iris)
