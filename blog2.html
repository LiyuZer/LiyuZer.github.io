    <h1>Kindness: A Tool, or Baggage?</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>What is Kindness? Many times in my own life, I have been told to be kind. Kindness is a virtue, an important one at that. But what is kindness?</p>

        <p>Kindness is often defined as being compassionate toward others. What is compassion? Compassion is the ability to understand the suffering of others and to try and ease it. So kindness, then, is being a compassionate person. In some ways, there exists a bidirectional relationship between the two.</p>

        <p>The issue with kindness is that it is not always reciprocated. At times, frustration may arise from the lack of reciprocation. This frustration may lead to a feeling of resentment. Resentment is a feeling of anger or displeasure stemming from a belief that one has been wronged.</p>

        <p>Why do we feel resentment? To feel resentment requires a layer of responsibility we place on others. We expect others to act in a certain way, and when they do not, we feel wronged.</p>

        <p>This is where the issue lies: in expecting kindness from others, we are in a net lose situation. We are giving kindness with the expectation of receiving it.</p>

        <h2>Kindness as a Tool?</h2>
        <p>Let us dwell on this for a moment. Why would an organism be kind? What benefit does one have? In fact, from my experience, kindness at times can negatively impact your chances of prospering. At least on a personal level, it is hard to argue for the benefits of great kindness.</p>

        <p>You might be thinking to yourself, "But kindness can be a toolâ€”a tool to get what you want." This is true, but then is it really kindness? If you are being kind to someone with the expectation of receiving something in return, then is it really kindness?</p>

        <p>That is more of a transaction than an act of kindness. So what is kindness, then? To me, kindness serves a different purpose.</p>

        <h2>The Purpose of Kindness</h2>
        <p>Close your eyes and think of the kindest person you know. Do they happen to be the wealthiest person you know? The most successful? The most powerful? Probably not.</p>

        <p>However, their kindness, like a spring of water in the desert, is a source of life. Kindness to me is a social phenomenon evolved from social animals. It is a way to maintain social cohesion. You see, while kindness may not always be reciprocated, it results in direct benefits to other groups, which will at times lead to higher rates of survival.</p>

        <p>Suppose one gives food to another; the other will be more likely to survive. Thus, the society as a whole benefits, even though the specific individual may not. Now you may wonder how kindness then passes down through generations. You see, societies with kinder people benefit from this kindness, so they might be more likely to survive.</p>

        <p>This is a very simplistic view of kindness, but it is one that I find to be quite compelling. Kindness is not a tool, nor is it a burden. It is a social phenomenon that has evolved to benefit societies as a whole.</p>

        <p>I do not want to be kind because I am inherently kind. Rather, I want to be kind as I see the benefits of kindness. Like not spitting gum on the sidewalk, it is a small act that benefits society as a whole. Too much of anything is bad, and so with a ruler, one must measure their kindness.</p>

        <p>What do you think? Is kindness a tool, a burden, or a social phenomenon?</p>
        <p>May the pseudo-deterministic universe be ever in your favor.</p>
