        <h1>A Graph-Based Programming Language</h1>

        <p>
            I’ve always wanted to create things. Since childhood, the urge to build and understand systems has motivated me. As my technical knowledge grew, I began exploring how programs and abstractions are constructed at a fundamental level.
        </p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            This drive led me to <strong>Automa</strong>, a language centered on graph-based computation. The idea came while writing code to match regular expressions using state machines. I realized that constructing and running automata should be more intuitive, and that most general-purpose languages are not well suited for expressing such systems directly.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Idea</h2>
        <p>
            At its core, a Turing machine—or any automaton—is just a set of states and transitions. Why not create a language that makes the structure of these machines explicit and programmable, with graphs as a first-class model?
        </p>

        <h2>Concepts</h2>
        <p>
            The distinction between deterministic and non-deterministic computation became central to my thinking. Non-deterministic simulations can explore many paths; adding memory yields more powerful machines like pushdown automata and Turing machines. In a programming context, this allows for modeling computation where state, memory, and logic are fully explicit.
        </p>

        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
            My goal for Automa is to provide a unified way to express computations as state machines, supporting features like non-deterministic execution, memory, and clear guarantees on program behavior. The ambition is to make automata not just a theoretical tool, but a practical programming model.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project is ongoing and ambitious, but I’m committed to developing it further. This is both a technical and personal challenge: building a system from the ground up, rooted in the principles that first inspired me.
