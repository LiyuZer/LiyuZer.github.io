        <h1>A Graph-Based Programming Language</h1>

        <p>I have always wanted to create things. Since childhood, I have felt a deep urge to build something greater than myself, to exist in a world of my own creation. The desire to construct, to iterate over my own ideas and concepts, has always driven me. However, in my younger years, I often felt frustrated by my lack of technical understanding. How could I create when I barely understood the world around me?</p>

        <p>Not that one can ever fully understand the world, but knowledge, even in fragments, provides a foundation for creation. Over time, as I have learned more, I have begun to see glimpses of how things work, allowing me to channel that childhood desire into something tangible.</p>

        <h2>The Motivation for Automa</h2>
        <p>This persistent urge to create led me to conceive <strong>Automa</strong>, a programming language grounded in graph-based computation. The idea first struck me while solving a programming problem with a friend. We were implementing a function that took in text and verified if it matched a regex expression. I recall thinking—wouldn't it be intuitive to construct an NFA to traverse and validate the pattern?</p>

        <p>While attempting to implement this in Python, I found the process tedious. Manually creating nodes, defining transitions, and setting conditions in a language not optimized for such a task felt cumbersome. This inefficiency lingered in my mind for a long time. After all, at its core, a Turing machine is a finite automaton—finite states that transition given some diagram. Why not create a programming language where state machines could be dynamically represented as graphs?</p>

        <h2>The Epiphany</h2>
        <p>During a quiet work session in the library, it finally clicked. I could build a language tailored for constructing and running finite state machines as graphs. The realization was exhilarating but daunting—where would I even begin?</p>

        <p>I started researching similar concepts and consulting every resource I could find (including the almighty pretrained transformer). I knew what I wanted: a language where finite state machines formed the fundamental structure, faithfully adhering to automata theory while remaining practical.</p>

        <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
        <p>A recurring theme that fascinated me was the contrast between deterministic and non-deterministic computation. Given a graph G, a non-deterministic simulation could explore multiple paths in parallel, identifying viable transitions dynamically. Adding memory to finite state machines also intrigued me—pushdown automata, for instance, are NFAs augmented with a stack interface, while Turing machines introduce a tape-based memory interaction.</p>

        <p>Beyond theoretical applications, these machines could model classical algorithms, storing the computational result within memory. Given an input K, a state machine could carry out the computation and preserve the residual state—a compelling and elegant approach.</p>

        <h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
        <p>My goal with Automa is to integrate these concepts into a single, cohesive language—one that enables programming through state machines with well-defined guarantees. I envision writing entire programs in a state-machine paradigm, seamlessly blending acceptance conditions, non-deterministic path exploration, and graph-based logic.</p>

        <p>It will take time to bring this vision to reality, but I am determined to see it through. This project is more than just a language—it is a personal challenge, a manifestation of the creative urge that has driven me since childhood.</p>

        <p>I'll end it here. The journey continues.</p>
